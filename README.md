# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

The goal of the task was to go through an example website for a marketing agency and bringit to accessibility standard, and to optimise it for search engines.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Method

When refactoring this web app I took a few passes through. First I passed through cleaning up the code and formatting, then I went through the CSS.

When going through CSS I found and removed a few redundacies and condensed the selectors for efficiency.

I then went through the document adding accessible alt tags. I had to convert a css background image to an inline <img> tag in order to add a tag, I had some difficulty with this as it required completely new css to make it sit in the webpage properly.

I then went through and replaced all divs with semantic hmtl5 elements and updated CSS to reflect this.
